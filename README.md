# Analytical Mechanics Assignments
- Assignment1: In this project, we simulate the trajectory of a pendulum which is connected to a disk and
this disk has an angular momentum of Ï‰.
we use Lagrangian mechanics and Euler-Lagrange equation to analysis this problem.
- Assignment2: In this project, we simulate the trajectory of an object presented in the nb file.
